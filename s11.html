                        One day Sameer, your best friend in class, is called by the teacher in front of the entire class, where the teacher asks openly in the class what Sameer was doing so close to Dhruv in the Playground. As soon as the teacher said this in front of the whole class Sameerâ€™s face was filled with fear, at that spur of the moment he told the teacher in front of the whole class that he was gay. As soon as he said that there was dead silence in the class, everyone started whispering to each other, the teacher made the class silent and gave Sameer a moral lecture about how he should conduct himself and how his feelings were unnatural.
                        What would you as a best friend do in this situation and how would your feelings and behavior change on learning this fact about him?
